# Notes: 
1- Please do not mass download with Kodachi VPN we need to enjoy low latency and remember you are not alone to enjoy it!
2- I post all Kodachi announcements on Twitter @warith2020
3- Always check the website for new instructions on every new release
4- Please donate to the project my life/pleasure/age is being wiped by this OS to reach up to this level!


# Milestones:
1- I tried my best to get Encrypted persistence to work but Ubuntu has removed it from casper were Debian based distros can have it because its based on and running live-boot but Ubuntu uses casper let us hope they put it back.
2- I tried to move to Ubuntu 20.04 but Python deprecation was a hassle for me to continue so I continued with 18.04.6 for now bare in mind that 18.04 support is still valid for Ubuntu and it should reach end of life by April 2023.
3- Riseup VPN uses Ipv6 this makes DNScrypt TOR DNS, and torrify non functional I will try to find a solution in future releases.
