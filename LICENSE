I have not disclosed any information of Kodachi users, and I have not been
forced to modify the OS to allow access or data leakage to a third party of
any kind.

As of April 06, 2022 I state the following:

I have NOT received any National Security letters regarding the Linux
Kodachi OS;
I have NOT received any gag orders;
I have NOT received any warrants from any government organization.
I am 100% committed to ensure users ultimate privacy and security on my
humble knowledge with he help and support of the Linux Kodachi community.
Kodachi nodes are very secure I use them my self and I also have TLS
authentication enabled in all of them. Meanwhile I regularly destroy VPS
nodes and create new once so system logs are all wiped out and we all have
new fresh ips to enjoy private and peaceful Internet
